# Contact-List-Editor

The following program emulates a contact repository that contains an individual's name and number. There are interactive features built in the menu bar that allows the user to add contacts, remove contacts, update contacts, search through the list of contacts, and sort the contacts in alphabetical order. To populate the program initially it requires a file with the extension ".dat", the contents within that file must be formated as follows: </br>
First name Last name, ###-###-#### </br>
Each contact entry is started on a new line.
